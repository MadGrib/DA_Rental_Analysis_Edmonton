### Methodology

To achieve the project's objective, I collected and analyzed data on rent prices and crime rates from various reliable sources. The rent prices were meticulously categorized into four types: Studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, and 3+bedroom apartments and townhouses, ensuring a detailed analysis of rental options available in each neighbourhood. The crime rates were obtained from official crime statistics, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data.

### Tech Stack:

- Excel: Used for basic data manipulation and data exploration
- SQL: Used for creating joins, cleaning, and transforming data
- Tableau: Used for visualizing the data analysis results

### Project Limitations and Areas for Improvement

- Limited data availability: The analysis heavily relies on the data collected from various sources. However, the availability and completeness of the data may vary, which could impact the accuracy of the analysis. Obtaining more comprehensive and up-to-date data would enhance the reliability of the findings.
- Additional factors for consideration: While this project focuses on rent prices and crime rates, there are other important factors to consider when choosing a rental property, such as proximity to amenities, transportation options, and quality of schools. Expanding the analysis to include additional factors would provide a more comprehensive evaluation for individuals seeking rental properties.
- Real-time updates: The data used in this analysis may not reflect the most recent changes in rent prices and crime rates. Implementing a system for real-time data updates would ensure that the insights provided remain accurate and up-to-date for users.

Overall, by addressing these limitations and making improvements, the project can offer even more valuable insights to individuals looking to rent a property in Edmonton.
